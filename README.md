## Features

- **User Authentication**: Sessions are managed using `Session.php`, ensuring secure login and access control for students and admins.
- **Database Connectivity**: Uses `Connection.php` for secure and reliable database connections with prepared statements.
- **Course Enrollment**: Fetches and displays available courses by category (core, electives, major/minor) based on department and semester.
- **Performance Metrics**: Dynamic SGPA and CGPA calculations, displayed through interactive radar and doughnut charts.
- **Course Management**: Allows adding, updating, and deleting courses. Enforces enrollment limits based on course category.
- **Light/Dark Mode**: Adaptive UI that changes based on user preference.
- **Smooth Loading**: Enhances user experience by ensuring smooth page transitions on reload.

## Database Structure

This project includes multiple tables, triggers and views for managing student, course, and role information.

### Tables

- **announcements**: Stores announcements made by teachers or administrators, including title, content, posting date, and author.

- **courses**: Holds information about each course, including course code, name, description, credits, and the department and semester it is offered.

- **course_selections**: Manages the courses students select based on available enrollments and course categories.

- **departments**: Lists the departments in the institution, each with a unique ID and name.

- **enrollment_types**: Categorizes different types of enrollments, such as core or elective courses.

- **enrolls_in**: Tracks student enrollments in specific courses, including enrollment year and semester details.

- **gender_definitions**: Stores gender definitions for student and faculty profiles.

- **grades**: Manages student grades for each course, linking to both the student and course information by semester and academic year.

- **instructors**: Contains instructor information, including name and contact details.

- **instructor_assignments**: Maps instructors to their course assignments.

- **mentorship**: Manages instructor-student mentorship assignments by semester, connecting students to faculty mentors within departments.

- **quotes**: Stores motivational or informational quotes, often used in notifications or dashboard messages.

- **roles**: Defines different user roles within the system, such as student, teacher, or admin.

- **role_associations**: Associates users with specific roles, enabling role-based access within the application.

- **students**: Stores key student information such as ID, name, roll number, university number, and current semester.

- **teaches**: Links instructors to the courses they teach.

- **users**: Manages all system users, including their login credentials and roles.
  

### Triggers

- **after_course_insert**: Automatically enrolls students into a core course when a new core course is added. This inserts enrollment records for all students in the same department and semester as the course.

- **after_course_acceptance**: Once a course selection is accepted, this trigger enrolls the student into the course by adding an entry in the `Enrolls_In` table with the current year.

- **update_instructor_email**: Updates the email in the `users` table whenever an instructor's contact information is updated.

- **auto_enroll_core_courses**: Automatically enrolls new students into core courses available in their department and semester upon student insertion.

- **auto_enroll_core_courses_after_update**: Enrolls students into core courses if their department or semester is updated, ensuring they are matched with the correct department and semester core courses.

- **update_student_email**: Updates the email in the `users` table whenever a student's email is modified.

### Views
  
- **student_sgpa_cgpa**: Stores semester grade point averages (SGPA) and cumulative grade point averages (CGPA) for students
